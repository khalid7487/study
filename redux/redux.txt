Redux Fllow diagram:-
        
        (dispatch)
Actions --------> stoe ----------------------------> Reducer

Here action is the entrance of store.

For immutable Redux store you need to either used spread operator or immer as a library.


Important note:

when you subscribed a store you need to unsubscribed it also

const unsubscribed = sotre.subscribed(() => {
    console.log("store changed!", store.getState());
});

store.dispatch({
    type: "bugAdded",
    payload:{
        description: "Bug1"
    }
});

unsubscribed();

store.dispatch({
    type: "bugRemoved",
    payload:{
        description: "Bug1"
    }
});
