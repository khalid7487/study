## Recursion

"defining a problem in terms of itself" that's mean it call a function itself.
 
**Porns**
1. Brid ges the gap between elegance and complexity. 
2. Can reduce time complexity with memorization.

**Cons**
1. slowness due to cpu overhead.
2. can be unecessarly complex if poorly constructed.

## TWO Case 
1.  **Base Case:** which is responsible for break functions.
2. **Progressive approach:** The recursive calls should progress in such a way that each time a recursive call is made it comes closer to the base criteria.

## Call stack: 
Recursion workes with call stack . Example below:

`suppose at morning in office you check your email, 
during that time your boss interrupt you to arrange a meeting,
during that time your boss interrupt you again to impressed investors,
during that time your jr call you to help him.`

Now, you finises your work from reverse orders.
