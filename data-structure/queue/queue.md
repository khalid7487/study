## Queue:
 Queue is a linear data structure, which follows the order of FIFO(first in first out). You may consider of queue is the waiting line in front of a bank booth, first come first get money and out first.

**You need to consider two things mostly for queue:**
1. Enqueue(insert).
2. dequue(delete).

**suppose you have an array:**
let arr =[2,5,6,7,12];
