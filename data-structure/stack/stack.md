## Stack:
Stacks are linear data structures that allow operations only on one end, meaning that all basic operations like inertion can only be done at the ends of the structure. This reason is because of the concept of Last in First Out(LIFO).

## Basic operations 
1. Push - inserts into the stack.
2. Pop - deletes from the stack.
